# Pipewire Sample Rate Config

Forked from https://github.com/cyber-sushi/pipewire-sample-rate-config.

This fork uses PySide6 for the UI which looks a bit nicer on KDE.

Original description
---

A simple GUI script written in Python to change Pipewire's sample rate and buffer size.

You can use ``pw-top`` to confirm that the changes are working.

Requires ``python3`` and ``pyside6`` installed.
Feedback is appreciated.
